title: Coffee Machine Simulator with Java
language: English
summary: "<div>\r\n<p>What can be better than a cup of coffee during a break? A coffee\
  \ that you don’t have to make yourself. It’s enough to press a couple of buttons\
  \ on the machine and you get a cup of energy; but first, we should teach the machine\
  \ how to do it.<br>\r\nIn this project, you'll program a coffee machine simulator\
  \ using Java. The machine works with typical products: coffee, milk, sugar, and\
  \ plastic cups; if it runs out of something, it shows a notification. You can get\
  \ three types of coffee: espresso, cappuccino, and latte. Since nothing’s for free,\
  \ it also collects the money.<br>\r\nThis project allows you to better understand\
  \ the basic OOP, its main concepts such as classes, class methods and attributes,\
  \ and get a taste of Java. Practice working with methods, challenge yourself with\
  \ loops and conditions, and get more confident with OOP.</p>\r\n</div><br/><br/>Learn\
